# design-patterns
What is software architecture. The answer is multitiered. At the highest level, there  are the architecture patterns that define the overall shape and structure of software  applications1 . Down a level is the architecture that is specifically related to the purpose of the software application. Yet another level down resides the architecture of  the modules and their interconnections. This is the domain of design patterns2 , packakges, components, and classes. It is this level that we will concern ourselves with in  this chapter. Our scope in this chapter is quite limitted. There is much more to be said about the  principles and patterns that are exposed here.
